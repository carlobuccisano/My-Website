# About me

## I'm on the job market.


Hi all, I'm Carlo!

I recently completed a PhD in Mathematics from the [Orsay Mathematics Department](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) under the supervision of [Benjamin Hennion](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~hennion/) and [Emanuele Macr√¨](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~macri/).

My PhD thesis is titled *On derived D-modules and their several definitions*.

<!-- The broad subject I worked in is derived algebraic geometry, which mixes homotopy theory with algebraic geometry. More specifically, I focused on *derived* D-modules, an extension of classical algebraic D-modules to derived schemes which remembers and exploits the additional derived information. Some keywords are (derived) Lie algebroids, ind-coherent sheaves and \(\infty\)-categories. -->

My broad research area is derived algebraic geometry.

Aside from mathematics, I'm interested in programming and everything Linux-related.
During my free time I enjoy cooking, brewing coffee, calisthenics, bikepacking and general mountaineering.
