# About me


Hi all, I'm Carlo!

I'm a mathematician looking for a Data Science role in the industry.

I hold a PhD in Mathematics from the [Orsay Mathematics Department](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) under the supervision of [Benjamin Hennion](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~hennion/) and [Emanuele Macrì](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~macri/). 
I did research in derived algebraic geometry, which mixes modern homotopy theory with algebraic geometry. For more information about it, check out [Research](/research). 

Right now, I am studying to improve my Data Science and Machine Learning knowledge and practical skills.

Generally speaking, I am passionate about programming (C++ and Python), using Arch Linux and custom ROMs for mobile phones.
Moreover, I am starting to enter into the world of homelabs and self-hosting.

[//]: # (I'm a fast learner and motivated worker; my strengths include perseverance, autonomy and direct communication skills.)

During my free time I enjoy stir frying, making espresso, practicing calisthenics and mountaineering.

Feel free to reach out!
