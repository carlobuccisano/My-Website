    The so called theory of derived D-modules is an extension of classical D-modules to derived algebraic geometry, which uses the derived information of the base scheme. We prove that the three different definitions of derived D-modules, given by Beraldo, Nuiten and Toën-Vezzosi, on a (nice) derived scheme yield equivalent symmetric monoidal ∞-categories. We deduce this as a corollary of more general statements about Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of dg-Lie algebroids, proving a conjecture by E. Pavia, and about the relation between representations of a dg-Lie algebroid and some class of ind-coherent sheaves on the associated formal moduli problem, which can be of independent interest.
